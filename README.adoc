== Getting Started
* run `build+recreate.sh`

== Flow (trigger)
* We trigger one of our workflows via REST to our App.

== Flow (engine)
* we have our own little engine, as defined in `process(flow)`.
* it consists of the following steps:
** `search` : the `Store` for `Message[]`
** `map` : the `Message` to `AMail` (lazy or full, see `AMail`)
** `filter` : the `AMail` (e.g. by _subject_)
** `transform` : the `AMail` (e.g. set spam score)
** `action` : on the `AMail` (e.g. move to folder)
** `cleanup` : on the `Store` (e.g. flush some folder)

== AMail
* generally `AMail` is a proxy-less `String`-backed representation of a `Message`.
